# Den of Lords

In the Den of Lords you will be tasked with claiming the recently vacated thrown.
The last king, now laid to rest, had no legitimate heirs. The recent moot has
broken down and no new king could be decided upon. You will have the chance
to influence the outcome through diplomacy, war, and intrigue. You do not
have to be the one that sits on the thrown, but don't find your self on the
wrong side of the sword.

## Goals
1. Create a world broken down in regions.
2. Allow for some basic interactions with the world.
3. Create characters and an ownership system.
4. Create character to character interactions.
